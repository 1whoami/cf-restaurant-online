This file explains how to contribute code to cf-restaurant-online

## If You Make Changes
Click "Fork" at
[the cf-restaurant-online GitHub page](https://github.com/poikilos/cf-restaurant-online)
then using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) click clone,
choose your repository, paste your changes into the folder it created
(such as Documents/GitHub/cf-restaurant-online), then *commit* and
*push* in GitHub Desktop. That will help others in the community, as
this is an open source project. If your changes are fixes, or if your
enhancement is applicable to others and therefore should be part of
the main project, then after you commit and push click "Pull requests,"
at [the cf-retaurant-online GitHub page](https://github.com/poikilos/cf-restaurant-online),
New Pull Request, then compare across forks, and choose yours under
"compare." Describe your changes, then click "Create Pull Request."
If you like fixes and improvements, do this to encourage others to
do the same. This will lighten the load and is a main purpose behind
open source. This is also the only way the project will be maintained,
as the original author is not responding to requests.
