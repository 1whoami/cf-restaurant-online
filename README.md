* If you make fixes, go to the
  [repository](https://github.com/poikilos/cf-restaurant-online), click
  fork, then commit and push your changes to your repo, then submit a
  pull request. **This project is supported by community members like
  you.** I have only created this repo since the program is not
  maintained nor supported by the author, Codersfolder, and the code and
  sql file that generates the database were both formerly only on
  MediaFire (which has dangerous ads).
