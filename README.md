## If You Make Changes
Click "Fork" at [the cf-restaurant-online GitHub page](https://github.com/poikilos/cf-restaurant-online) then using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) click clone, choose your repository, paste your changes into the folder it created (such as Documents/GitHub/cf-restaurant-online), then *commit* and *push* in GitHub Desktop. That will help others in the community, as this is an open source project.
If your changes are fixes, or if your enhancement is applicable to others and should be part of the main project, then after you commit and push click "Pull requests," at [the cf-retaurant-online GitHub page](https://github.com/poikilos/cf-restaurant-online), New Pull Request, then compare across forks, and choose yours under "compare." Describe your changes, then click "Create Pull Request." If you like fixes and improvements, do this to encourage others to do the same. This will lighten the load and is a main purpose behind open source. This is also the only way the project will be maintained, as the original author is not responding to requests.

* If you make fixes, go to the
  [repository](https://github.com/poikilos/cf-restaurant-online), click
  fork, then commit and push your changes to your repo, then submit a
  pull request. **This project is supported by community members like
  you.** I have only created this repo since the program is not
  maintained nor supported by the author, Codersfolder, and the code and
  sql file that generates the database were both formerly only on
  MediaFire (which has dangerous ads so don't go to the following links
  [from the original Coders Folder blog article] which are only provided
  for backup purposes:
